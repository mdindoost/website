Oliver Alvarado Rodriguez is an incoming Software Engineer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise working on the Advanced Development Team where he will join the [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/) project. He successfully defended his Ph.D. dissertation in March 2025 at the New Jersey Institute of Technology under the advisement of Distinguished Professor [David A. Bader](https://davidbader.net/). His dissertation, "On the Design of a Framework for Large-Scale Exploratory Graph Analytics," focused on the development of [Arachne](https://github.com/Bears-R-Us/arkouda-njit), a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between high-performance computing and Python-based exploratory graph analytics. Oliver earned his B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics from William Paterson University in Wayne, NJ, graduating *summa cum laude* in May 2020. During his undergraduate studies, he was a member of the Honors College, the Upsilon Pi Epsilon Honor Society for the Computing and Information discipline, and was honored with the Omicron Omega Award for excellence in Computer Science.
